In addition to the latest insights into our bee monitoring technology and digital tools for your beekeeping, a special opportunity awaits you: We will soon be looking for committed beekeepers who would like to test the platform together with us. Your experience and data will not only contribute to the improvement of HIVESOUND, but will also be part of our Open Data project, which aims to share knowledge and insights with everyone for the benefit of bees and the environment. Be at the forefront of revolutionizing the world of beekeeping and help us achieve something great!"

            text: "We are looking for beekeepers to help us develop an AI-supported monitoring system for honey bee colonies. The AI should recognize when the bees are behaving unusually, e.g. when the queen is missing. In order for the AI to recognize this behavior, we need to feed it with data - but this is hardly publicly available and not very representative of the different honey bee breeds, hive types, site conditions, etc. This is where you come in: By testing the HIVESOUND platform (app), you generate data at the same time. Your data helps us to continuously improve the AI model and make reliable predictions. Both beekeepers and scientific institutions benefit from this (see „What happens to my data?“)"

            text: "The first feature of our „Queen@Home“ platform is designed to show you whether the queen is in the hive or not. The idea is: simply hold your smartphone under the hive and get an immediate response. Sign up and we will inform you promptly about the next steps!"

            text: "We are fans of open data. If you give your consent, we will make the collected data available for everyone to download in anonymized form. This is primarily for the benefit of science. Honey bees are excellent so-called biomonitors because they take in substances from their environment and react sensitively to changes in their environment. Our vision is a global biomonitoring system that will enable scientists to gain valuable insights from many different ecosystems."
