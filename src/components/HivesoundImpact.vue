        <p class="text-subtitle-1">
          Developing a platform for beekeepers and companies comitted to sustainability by keeping bees. Using AI driven
          frequency analysis and a simple-to-use monitoring system, we derive valuable information about their bee-colonies
          and the surrounding environment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-subtitle-1">
          This way, we cannot only contribute to preservance of honey bees and biodiversity, but ultimately,
          help ourselves to preserve a diverse and healthy nutrition, honey bee products and a colourful nature to
          marvel at.
