          With AI driven frequency analysis and a simple-to-use monitoring system we develop a platform for
          beekeeper and companies comitted to sustainability keeping bees to derive valuable information about their bee-colonies
          and the surrounding environment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-subtitle-1">
          This way, we cannot only contribute to preservance of honey bees and biodiversity, but ultimately,
          help ourselves to preserve a diverse and healthy nutrition, honey bee products and a colourful nature to
          marvel at.
