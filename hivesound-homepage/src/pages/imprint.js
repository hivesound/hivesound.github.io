                        Our offer contains links to external third-party websites over

                        content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for
                        possible legal violations at the time they were linked. No
                        illegal content was found at the time the link was created. A
                        permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not
                        reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law.
                        As soon as we become aware of legal violations, we will remove
                        such links immediately.

                        or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
                        Obligations to remove or block the use of information according
                        to general laws remain unaffected. However, liability in this
